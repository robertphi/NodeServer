# NodeServer
Just a simple back-end Node (Express) server for me to fiddle around with while I work on my Angular app (https://github.com/robertphi/AngularProject/).

This app assumes a MongoDB instance currently available on the default port (27017 I think). The DB should be named "mydb" (how original!). The "jsonForDB" folder contains some JSON you can use to populate collections for this DB. 

I'm not a expert on most of these tools (just playing around with them), and this repo is mostly intended to supplement Front-End projects.
